# Tkinter_Wordle
Local version of Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) using Tkinter in Python.

It uses the 1000 most common 5-letters words in English, open to accept other languages.

Format to run on Linux. Debugging to properly run on Mac and Windows (any help?).

Example of game in action:
